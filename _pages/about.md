I am a software engineer at [Meta](https://about.facebook.com/meta), working on developing machine leaning based solutions to industry-scale software engineering problems.
My research aims to address practical problems in software development, such as bug attribution, root cause analysis, code generation/synthesis, etc. using machine learning solutions.
Recently I am interested in representation learning for various software artifacts common in large scale industrial software development.
The projects I have worked on have found significant industrial impact at Meta.

# Bio

I have been a software engineer at Meta (Facebook) since 2018, where I work in developer infrastructure.
Before, I was a Research Scientist (postdoc) at Rice University from 2015-2018, working with [Swarat Chaudhuri](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~swarat) on the Pliny project.
Prior to that, I was a Ph.D. student at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg) (NUS) from 2009-2014, advised by [Joxan Jaffar](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~joxan).
I interned at IBM Research India during my Ph.D., working with [Satish Chandra](https://sites.google.com/site/schandraacmorg).
My Ph.D. background is originally in programming languages and formal methods, but my "ML coach" was [Chris Jermaine](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~cmj4) during my postdoc at Rice.
I obtained my B.Computing also from NUS in 2009.

My hometown is Chennai in south India. Outside research, I enjoy video games, backyard gardening, and traveling.
